# A Field Guide of Exotic Trees

A Python 3.7 app that generates random fractal-like trees and field guide entries for those trees. 

### To-do:
- [ ] Write field guide entries
- [ ] Tree generation
  - [ ] Symmetrical trees
  - [ ] Support specialized tree types such as tall trunk with foliage on top (palms), tall trunk with branches coming off near horizontally (classic conifers)
  - [ ] More control over tree generation?
- [ ] SVG Generation
  - [ ] Randomize tree colors
  - [ ] Explore SVG minification, [scour](https://github.com/scour-project/scour) might work but it's build as a CLI tool, or rasterization
